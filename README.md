# [RLSS 2019] Pratical Sessions

### Setup and Installation
Guides for downloading and installing PyTorch and all needed packages on Linux, MacOS and Windows using Docker can be found [here](setup.md).

*Note*: You won't need the `rlss2019-docker` image if you run the notebooks from Google Colab (Google Colab has it's own VM so you will just need to install the needed packages from inside the notebooks).

### Materials
#### Deep Reinforcement Learning
- [REINFORCE+A2C](labs/01.REINFORCE+A2C.ipynb)
- [DQN](labs/02.DQN.ipynb)
- [Model-Based](labs/03.ModelBased.ipynb)

#### Misc.
You are running Windows and want to install a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 18.04? [Here](ubuntu-virtual-box.md) is a tutorial.
