# [RLSS 2019] Pratical Sessions

## Setup and Installation
Guides for downloading and installing PyTorch and all needed packages on Linux, MacOS and Windows using Docker can be found [here](setup.md).

*Note*: You won't need the `rlss2019-docker` image if you run the notebooks from Google Colab :orange_book: (Google Colab has it's own VM so you will just need to install the needed packages from inside the notebooks). Use the `rlss2019-docker` image only if you want to run the notebooks locally.
