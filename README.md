# RLSS 2019: Pratical Sessions

## Setup and Installation
Two choices are available to you:
- running the notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) :orange_book: if you want to take advantage of the GPU acceleration it offers;
- running the notebooks elsewhere (locally or on a server).

##### Google Colab
It has it's own VM so you only have to install the necessary packages from inside the notebooks.
##### Elsewhere
You can use the `rlss2019-docker` image. [Here](setup.md) you'll find  the instructions for installing and running the `rlss2019-docker` image on Linux, MacOS or Windows.
