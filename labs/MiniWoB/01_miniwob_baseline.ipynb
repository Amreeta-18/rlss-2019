    "Mini World of Bits (MiniWoB) is an RL benchmark introduced by OpenAI researchers in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their original paper http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to create a set of browser-based tasks to be solved using RL methods. Every task is a small dynamic webpage, which could be interacted using a mouse or keyboard. The reward is given for executing correct sequence of actions. Description of the goal is included into the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total it introduced 80 problems of varying complexity -- from the trivial like clicking the form button to very challenging, for example booking the flight following the criterias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems are available here: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/miniwob-plusplus/\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, OpenAI discontinued MiniWoB project, so, it hasn't gained popularity it deserves. After OpenAI paper in 2017, MiniWoB was used in several research papers, the most notable ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [1802.08802 Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces Using Workflow-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08802)\n",
    "* [1812.09195 Learning to Navigate the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09195v1)\n",

    "\n",
    "But that's almost nothing in comparison to Atari games popularity. To fix this mistake, let's play with MiniWoB in this tutorial.\n",

    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "MiniWoB is implemented as a part of [OpenAI Universe](https://github.com/openai/universe) (another frozen project of OpenAI). The idea of Universe is to use VNC protocol to connect RL agent with GUI applications. As VNC is a cross-platform protocol used by humans to communicate with remote GUI applications, RL agent also achieves this ability (is RL agent smart enough to communicate is a different question). \n",

    "The original MiniWoB docker image is available [on quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/openai/universe.world-of-bits), but I suggest you to use my version with fixed stability issues. The fixed version is available [on dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/shmuma/repository/docker/shmuma/miniwob). If you want to build your own version of the fixed image, you can follow [instructions here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On/tree/master/Chapter13/wob_fixes)\n"

    "## Starting the container\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have docker installed, you can start the single container running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run -d -p 5900:5900 -p 15900:15900 --privileged --ipc host --cap-add SYS_ADMIN shmuma/miniwob run`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the options:\n",
    "* `-d` detaches container from terminal and keeps it running in background\n",
    "* `-p 5900:5900` forwards VNC port to the host machine\n",
    "* `-p 15900:15900` forwards rewarder port \n",
    "* `--privileged` gives extended privileges to this container (not sure is this needed or not, that was written in OpenAI manual)\n",
    "* `--ipc host` uses host's IPC namespace\n",
    "* `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` extends container privileges\n",
    "* `shmuma/miniwob` name of the container image to start, you can use `quay.io/openai/universe.world-of- bits:0.20.0` to start original MiniWoB image\n",
    "* `run` command to start inside container\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training, several containers could be started (to decrease training samples correlation), to simplify this process, this repo includes two scripts: `containers_run.sh` and `containers_stop.sh`. The first starts the required amount of containers (given in command line), the second script stops all started containers (be careful, it just stops ALL containers, not only started by `containers_run.sh` script)."
